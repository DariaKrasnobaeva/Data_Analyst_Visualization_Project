# Communicate Data Finding Project based in Flight Dataset
## by Daria Krasnobaeva


## Dataset

I was exploring a dataset containing monthly information about different Airlines and their attributes, such like flights delays and cancellations, for the timeslot of 10 years.

For my last part of analysis I created a sub dataframe, with one column for all delays and art of delays as entries in that column.


## Summary of Findings

I find out, that:
- distribution of all delays is similar: they all have a long-tailed distribution, with a lot of short delays and few very very long delays. The distribution has only one peak closed to 0.
When plotted on a log-scale, the delay distribution looks roughly unimodal and still skewed to the right.

- The most flights according to the database was canceled in 2019. But we can already see the impact of Corona Virus on our data (outliers in 2020). In the one Subplot we see, that after only 3 Month of 2020 we almost reach the level of cancellations of 2019. The 2019 is the year with the most cancellations, according to the data. My guess, that after the actualization of data 2020 that will hit the bar.

- After my observation it is also clear, that American Airlines Inc. having the most if delays, especially a lot Carrier delays. Express Airlines Inc. showed the interesting development from having a lot of delays to have less delays than other carriers. Sadly there is now data for 2020 from this company available.

- According to my analysis late aircraft delays are the most popular delays. On the second place it is carrier delay followed by NAS delay and weather delay.

- For me it was interesting to see, that weather delays actually playing not such a big roll in the whole picture. As well as that due to Corona Virus the Carrier delay went on the 1st place in 2020.



## Key Insights for Presentation

- My two key insights of presentation were the developing of different kind of delays for most common carrier in the dataset and summarized version of the delay development through the years.
