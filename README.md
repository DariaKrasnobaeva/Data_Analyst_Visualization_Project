Project Details
This project was done as a part of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree program. The objective of this project was to use Python visualization libraries to explore a dataset systematically. The analysis begins with exploring single variables followed by bivariate and multivariate analysis.

This analysis is followed by a short presentation to convey and highlight important findings using explanatory data analysis. A slide deck was prepared that followed the major path of exploration and a story was constructed for the readers to understand what was discovered.
